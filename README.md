# outbreak.info
During outbreaks of emerging diseases such as COVID-19, efficiently collecting, sharing, and integrating data is critical to scientific research.

outbreak.info is a standardized, searchable platform to discover and explore COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 data from the [Center for Viral Systems Biology](http://cvisb.org/) at Scripps Research. It contains three parts: a standardized searchable database of COVID-19 research; customizable real-time surveillance reports on SARS-CoV-2 variants and mutations; and an explorable interface to examine changes in epidemiological data.
